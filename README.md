# Candy-Crush
A JavaScript Game inspired by Candy Crush

In this project I made use of: 
+ Array methods 
+ Event listeners such as (dragstart, dragend, dragover, drop, dragleave and dragenter), so this can only be played on desktop
+ setAttribute()
+ setInterval()
+ And many more

You can play the game [here](https://onanuviie.github.io/Candy-Crush/)
